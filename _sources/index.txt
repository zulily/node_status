=======================================

**node_status version:** |version|

``node_status`` is a chef-related `command-line tool <./node_status.html>`_ providing functionality similar
to that of knife's *status* subcommand.  It offers filtering, various output formats with sorting, and it is
very fast, thanks to its use of partial search.
